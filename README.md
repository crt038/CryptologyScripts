# Cryptology Scripts
This repository is a collection of scripts that reflect the functionality of some cryptographic systems, namely encryption and (some) decryption methods. More specifically, this is based upon the material covered by [Hatice Sahinoglu](https://www-math.umd.edu/people/lecturers/item/1372-hsahinog.html) in CMSC456: Cryptography at the University of Maryland, College Park, during the Fall 2025 semester.

## Quickstart Guide
1. Code -> Download ZIP -> unzip CryptologyScripts.zip
2. cd into DownloadLocation/CryptologyScripts/scripts
3. run "'ciphername'.py -h" for details about how to use in CLI
4. If I haven't implemented CLI usage for a cipher you want to check out, you
can still open the scripts, put in some print statements, and see output that way

## Systems That I am Thinking of Implementing and/or Those Which I Have Already Finished
- [Shift (Caesar) Cipher](https://github.com/crt038/CryptologyScripts/blob/main/scripts/shiftcipher.py)
- [Affine Cipher](https://github.com/crt038/CryptologyScripts/blob/main/scripts/affinecipher.py)
- [Vigenere Cipher](https://github.com/crt038/CryptologyScripts/blob/main/scripts/vigenere.py)
