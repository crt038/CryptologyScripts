# Cryptology Scripts
This repository is a collection of scripts that reflect the functionality of some cryptographic systems, namely encryption and (some) decryption methods. More specifically, this is based upon the material covered by Hatice Sahinoglu in CMSC456: Cryptography at the University of Maryland, College Park, during the Fall 2025 semester.
